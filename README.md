## About Me

I'm quiet proficient in English even though it's not my first language, and yes, gua memang bisa ngomong Bahasa Indonesia.\
I'm a developer (if you can call me that), currently in high school.

I'm familiar with the quirks and syntax of c and c++, know python decently well, sort-of know js and rust, annoyed with java, always
forgetting html tags, css selectors, want to learn haskell but dammit, it's hard, etc. I am also familiar with linux (native, wsl, msys, etc),
git (although I always have to open the man page every time), vim (even though I never remember the more specific key combos),
and emacs (even though I could only barely use doom emacs).

And lastly, yes I use arch linux (endeavouros), and yes it's my daily driver.

## Some stats

Here's some stats: (yes I've been inactive for quiet a long time)
