## Hi There.

You could see my username, you could see my pfp.

### About Me

I'm absolutely not going to leak my personal detail. I'm not the kind of person
to be comfortable with people snooping around my social media profiles.

But, I'm a developer, still in high school, familiar with the syntax and quirk of c and c++,
know python well enough, kinda know js, rust.

I also am familiar with git, linux, vim, and... nah that's it.

I'm just going to drop some stats below, not going to bother adding more embed than that
since I just don't like too much *✨**fancy**✨* embeds...
