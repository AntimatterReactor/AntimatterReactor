## About Me

Indonesian ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©. [C2 English User] (https://cert.efset.org/oZpzeD)

Familiar with C, C++, Rust. Know HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, and Bash. Can somewhat read Go and Java.

Also familiar with Linux, mostly GNU/Linux in many, many different forms (incl. WSL and MSYS2). Tried Void Linux and BSD but still unfamiliar.

Understand Git, the basics of Vim, and have used modded Emacs.

Prefers Linux for software development. Yes, I use Arch Linux. Although I like Fedora more on account of less breaks from updates.

Here's some stats that I'm not planning on fixing anytime soon:
