# Hiya!

My name is Ezra, I live in Jakarta, Indonesia.

## About Me

I'm quiet proficient in English even though it's not my first language, and
yes, gua memang bisa ngomong Bahasa Indonesia.

Regarding personal details, I beg you not to snoop around too much. But in case you do search my name on google...<br>
What can I do about it anyway? You'll probably find my photo (as an 11 yo primary school student) and not much else.<br>
Although... I do have a secret alt identity where I'm not *enclosetado*, if you will.

But, I'm a developer (if you can call me that), currently in high school.

I'm familiar with the quirks and syntax of c and c++, know python decently well, sort-of know js and rust, annoyed with java, always
forgetting html tags, css selectors, want to learn haskell but dammit, it's hard, etc.

Anyways, I'm currently making a website, where? Guess.

I am also familiar with linux (native, wsl, msys, etc), git (although I always have to open the man page every time),
vim (even though I never remember the more specific key combos), and emacs (even though I could only barely use doom emacs).

And lastly, yes I use arch linux (endeavouros), and yes it's my daily driver.

## Some stats

Here's some stats: (yes I've been inactive for quiet a long time)
